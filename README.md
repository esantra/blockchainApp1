This blockchain node.js app was completed in a very short time. It stores a copy of the Weather.com (The Weather Channel) 10 day weather forecast in the blockchain via <a href="https://docs.arweave.org/developers/">Arweave</a> apis on the exact time it was accessed. For example, if you run the program on Tuesday, it will store the exact forecast for Tuesday and when you retrieve it, you will see Tuesday's forecast. In this manner, you can compare Tuesday's 10 day forecast with Friday's and see if the forecast was wrong or perhaps altered from some unknown natural event ;) Have fun!
